// Add all your components, helpers and modifiers to the template registry here, so apps don't have to do this.
// See https://typed-ember.gitbook.io/glint/environments/ember/authoring-addons

// import type MyComponent from './components/my-component';

// Uncomment this once entries have been added! ðŸ‘‡
